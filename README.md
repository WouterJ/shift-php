# ShiftPHP

Welcome at ShiftPHP, a very simple event driven, MOVE oriented framework for PHP.

## Contributing

A framework can only get good with the contributions of other people. Issues,
discussions and pull requests are very welcome! There are not many rules, as
long as you stick to the 
[Symfony Standards](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html).

## License
